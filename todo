TODO

(Mechanics)
1. Website interface
  - Static site hosted with GitHub pages?
  - Learn tailwind
  - JS should just send a HTTP request
2. Terminal interface
  - Make HTTP request with shell? (can you even do this?)
3. Server
  - API code
  - Database of users? Or just IPs?
  - Database of messages to-be-viewed
  - Host this online
    - Railway? Azure? Heroku, even? I still need a good solution for this...

(Content/guidelines)
- Messages should delete after set amount of time viewed
- This needs to be HTTPS at some point
- Way to create account with HTTP requests, both from website and terminal
